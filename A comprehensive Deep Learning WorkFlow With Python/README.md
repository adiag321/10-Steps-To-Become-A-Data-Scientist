#  a comprehensive Deep Learning techniques with python
Each framework is built in a different manner for different purposes. In this Notebook, I look at the 5 deep learning frameworks to give you a better idea of which framework will be the perfect fit or come handy in solving your **business challenges**.

This is a comprehensive Deep Learning techniques with python, it is clear that everyone in this community is familiar with MNIST dataset and other data sets that I want to use in this kernel such as Quora but if you need to review your information about the dataset please visit MNIST(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), Quora(https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification).



We use a machine algorithm to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned. Basically, Deep Learning is used in layers to create an Artificial Neural Network that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own. We can say Deep Learning is a sub-field of Machine Learning.
