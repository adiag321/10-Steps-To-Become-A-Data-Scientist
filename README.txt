#  Introduction

If you Read and Follow **Job Ads** to hire a machine learning expert or a data scientist, you find that some skills you should have to get the job.
In this Repository, I want to review **10 skills** that are essentials to get the job.

In fact, this Repository is a reference for **10 other Notebooks**, which you can learn with them,  all of the skills that you need.
# 1-Python
Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

You can read and learn following topic on this Notebook:

1. web development (server-side)

1. software development

1. mathematics

1. system scripting.

1. Basics

1. Functions

1. Types and Sequences

1. More on Strings

1. Reading and Writing CSV files

1. Dates and Times

1. Objects and map()

1. Lambda and List Comprehensions

1. OOP

# Do You Need Help?

I hope, you have enjoyed reading my python notebooks.

If you have any problem and question to run notebooks please open an issue here in GitHub.

for most of the my notebooks you need **dataset** as input.

To use the **correct data**, please **download** the data set from  the **Kaggle** site and put it in your notebook folder.
