# How to solve a Real Data Science Problem:
If you have already read some machine learning books. You have noticed that there are different ways to stream data into machine learning.

Most of these books share the following steps:

* Define Problem
* Specify Inputs & Outputs
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Collection
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Cleaning
* Visualization
* Model Design, Training, and Offline Evaluation
* Model Deployment, Online Evaluation, and Monitoring
* Model Maintenance, Diagnosis, and Retraining
 Of course, the same solution can not be provided for all problems, so the best way is to create a general framework and adapt it to new problem.

You can see my workflow in the below image :
